Day 1. Learning Python journey started. I started by refreshing my python understanding by walking through python basics like lists, tupels, dictionaries, loops, and more others.

 Day 2.

 File handling.

 Learning how to write, read and append contents to the file. I have practiced it by building daily journal. It prompts the user to enter the action type, anf it it is registering a content, it will ask you to select which type of content you are inserting whether title, subtitle or description. You can view all the contents inside the journal and more. Searching also posible here. When you are done, please select 4 to exit from the application.
